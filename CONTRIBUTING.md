# CONTRIBUTING

Got a custom editor theme you think should be included?  We'd love to have it!  Here's how to contribute:

1. Fork this repo into your own GitHub account.
2. Add your theme to the `lib` folder, following the existing examples.  Your `.ms` file should be named like `theme-`_something_`.ms`, with a screen shot (showing sampleCode.ms) of the same name but with a `.png` extension.  The `.ms` file should have comments at the top describing the theme, with author and date.  (Author contact info is optional and may take whatever form you choose: email address, GitHub profile, Discord ID, whatever.)
3. Submit a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

That's it!  I look forward to seeing your custom theme.
